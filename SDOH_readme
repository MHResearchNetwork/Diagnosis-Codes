Social Determinants of Health and Adverse Life Event Diagnosis code list

This is an inclusive superset of the ICD-9 and ICD-10 code lists sourced from:
ICD-9: Torres et. al 2017 https://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/fulltext/2017/09000/ICD_Social_Codes__An_Underutilized_Resource_for.2.aspx
ICD-10: Elyse Llamocca to MHRN, 2022

The codes and classifications did not map perfectly.  The final categories are:

Abuse and neglect 
Child welfare placement 
Disappearance/death of family member
Educational problems
Employment or financial problems
Exposure to violence
Family alcohol/drug use
Family disruption by separation/divorce
Housing instability
Legal issues
Nonspecific psychosocial needs
Other family problems
Parent-child conflict
Social environmental problem

Please review the list carefully.  You may want to remove some codes.  For example, fot the antidepressant personalization
project (Aug 2024) we decided to move PTSD and military deployment to new categories, remove institutional residence
and codes relating to perpetrators.
