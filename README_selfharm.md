The MHRN diagnosis lists contain ICD-10 codes we are using to identify self-harm and suicide attempt.  These were validated by chart review in ICD-9, but the process of validating these after the ICD-10 transition is not complete.

**The algorithm we currently use is:**

1. Self-inflicted Injury/Poisoning

**or**

2. Undetermined Injury/Poisoning 

**or**

3. Suicide Ideation AND Injury/Poisoning subset *on the same day.*

For time periods spanning the ICD-10 transition, we recommend this or at least 1 + 2 criteria. Our observations so far suggest that the 3rd "or" is less important for ICD-10 than ICD-9.
