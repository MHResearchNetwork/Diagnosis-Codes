UPDATE 4/23/2020

mhrn_dx_codes.zip has flags:
 * "DSH" for definite self-harm (self-inflicted codes in ICD-10 ) 
 * "PSH" for possibly self-inflicted (undetermined in ICD-10)  
 * "SUI" for suicide ideation 
Whether or not you include PSH is a project-specific decision.

Previous:
The MHRN diagnosis lists contain ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes we are using to identify self-harm and suicide attempt.  These were validated by chart review in ICD-9, but the process of validating these after the ICD-10 transition is not complete.  For now we recommend using only codes where DSH=1.

If you are working with pre-Oct 2015 data, see third reference below for the self-harm definition we used in 2015.
